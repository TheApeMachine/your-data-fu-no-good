## Data Intelligence Platform overview
- Purpose: Cloudflare Workers + Hono application that ingests CSV/JSON files (and MongoDB collections) and automatically produces statistical analyses, correlations, trend lines, network graphs, bookmarks, and an AI chat assistant for data exploration.
- Architecture: single Vite bundle that serves a Hono router (`src/index.tsx`) with JSX-rendered UI via `renderer.tsx`. API routes live under `src/routes` (upload/analyze/datasets/mappings/chat/etc.) and share utilities in `src/utils`. Cloudflare D1 (migrations/*.sql) stores datasets, rows, analyses, visualizations, cleaning operations, and column mappings; MongoDB driver handles Atlas imports.
- Key tech: TypeScript (strict, ES modules), Vite, Hono w/ JSX, Cloudflare Pages + Workers (wrangler), D1 SQLite, MongoDB Node driver, Papaparse, Chart.js, Cytoscape.js, OpenAI Agents for AI chat/function-calling.
- Notable features: Neuromorphic UI, theme persistence, bookmarkable insights, chart export, network visualization, AI chat with streaming + database tool calls, MongoDB query generator endpoint, and roadmap entries for data cleaning execution + NL chart requests.
- Repo structure highlights: `src/` (index entrypoint, renderer, route modules, shared types/utils), `public/` static assets, `migrations/` D1 schema, `dist/` build output, `test-*.csv` sample data, `test-tools.sh` curl harness, docs (*.md) explaining OpenAI setup, advanced techniques, function-calling, etc.
